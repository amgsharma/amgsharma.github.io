      <div class="entry-content">
      <p>There are somedays when you awaken to beams of sunlight filtering through the drapes and the first thought that enters your head is “ Crud.” . Those are the days when you ought to heed your inner self and proceed to withdraw within the safe confines of your blanket and let the day slip by you, uneventful, boring, and safe. This past Sunday morning was of this variety. When I awoke to the theme song of “Mortal Kombat” screaming at me from my cell, I instinctively found the two-millimeter squared button that silences it, efficiently re-positioned myself into the most blissful position ever and was about to resume a most desirable image sequence when I remembered, I was supposed to be a host this weekend. I lazily reached for the phone and dialed the number of my guest who would be at that moment gently snoring on the futon on the living room. I heard the annoying chime of his cell (I have no idea why he refuses to download an mp3) and then his gravelly voice echoed in both my handset and through the hallway:
      <p> “ Hello?”</p>
      <p> “Dude, are you up?”</p>
      <p> "...No" </p>
      <p> "Ok call me when you're up then" </p>
      <p>And then after performing the ritual morning prayer in record time, we were both back to sleep. It wasn't till 1:00 PM that I heard a knock on my door. So again, not wanting to exert the tremendous reserves of energy that is required to elevate my sleeping limbs, I reach for the cell and called him again: “Dude, did you call me?”</p>
      <p> "Uh, yea" </p>
      <p> "Ok, what?" </p>
      <p> "You know I'm in the next room over right?" </p>
      <p> "Does this mean you're ready to go rafting?" </p>
      <p> "I guess" </p>
      <p>And this was how Sunday began.My buddy James and I (with whom I’ve survived many a triumph and tribulation), packed the car carefully ^ and headed out to ‘James River’ for an afternoon of rafting / tubing fun. We left the house not more than 5 minutes after leaving our beds. Armed with two bottles of water and a box of Entemanns deluxe doughnuts, what else could we need right? I mean, towels, food, extra clothing… these things aren’t necessary – right? We arrived at James River Runners in good time and were told that the rental agency – which was actually a shack with a pile of rubber tubes and about 6 canoes next to it – was no longer renting out tubes for the day. Refusing to be defeated, we changed into our bathing gear ( i.e. Took off our tee shirts and sandals) and entered the river. It wasn’t all that bad. The water was crystal clear, the ‘rapids’ were really not that rapid. The jagged rocks that plagued us from underfoot only really hurt when you stepped on them. All in all, once we arrived at a spot where there were rocks large enough to sit on, we had a good ‘ol time watching the other adventure seekers who were lucky enough to no be tempted by slumber, slowly make their way down the river. Though it remains an enigma to me how that one girl managed to tip her TUBE on a river this shallow… amazing. Laughs were had, jokes shared and silence ensued to further enhance the experience. We made our way back to the car (rather painfully) after the usual activities of stone skipping, swimming against the flow and all that. </p>
      <p>We made it back to the apartment in good time, wolfed down two lox sandwiches and doughnuts, then got ready to go to the main feature of the weekend – TheDisturbed concert at Nissan Pavillion, Bristow VA. I realized that I was supposed to swap the remaining fuel injector coils in the Maxima this Sunday morning and then wipe the codes so that my mechanic could further troubleshoot the annoying skip in the engine. With the engine light on, I was somewhat reluctant to take the car on the 80 mile trip. So I requested that we use Aleks’ car instead. He agreed somewhat, no wait, just plain reluctantly (with good reason as my dear reader will soon see). He argued that his car had a few problems also and didn’t want to risk the engine light coming on in the middle of nowhere. Since my engine light was currently an aesthetic feature to my dash, we agreed on using his car. </p>
      <p>On the way to the Pavillion, immediately after Aleks gassed up and pressured the tires, a beautiful display of random lights came up on his visual warning system. Wonderful. Lesson learnt: Want to destroy your enemy? Pressure his tires. Aleks’ theory was that the GPS system that I plugged into his cigarette lighter drained his battery. James and I settled on the theory that the alternator wasn’t recharging the battery. Oh well. We got to the concert, parked, bought beer ($10.00 a cup!!!! – chutzpah nora!) and heard the beginning notes of David Draiman’s primal screams as we walked towards our seats. The band was amazing. I think the best part of the concert for me was when David invited one of his fans up on stage – a nine year old girl who was in the midst of the mosh pit!! He asked her “Is this your first concert?” to which she replied “ It’s my 3rd”. He then said very sweetly to her “I’m gonna ask you to do one thing for me, whenever the bad words come out, I want you to cover your ears ok?” That was very cool. </p>
      <p>We left before the highlight band began playing because none of us could understand what the lead ‘singer’ was saying. Neither could I comprehend the need for the drummer to dress up like a tree. Leaving early was a great idea, we beat the traffic, but the car stalled. 70 miles away from home, no lights save for a brilliant Virginia moon, no stores, and one foot away from 16 wheelers zipping by at 70 miles per hour. Wonderful. A tow truck was called. He showed up an hour later with the most ghastly and ill mannered creature at his side. James speculated carelessly that it was his wife. I on the other hand had had enough of the night and was in such a foul mood, I wished that the man’s life was so miserable that the creature was his mistress. Not only did he charge us an arm and a leg for towing the car to a mechanic, he refused to take us home. The next thing I know, we’re walking once again, down this lonely stretch of road alongst west-bumble-f**k Virginia at midnight in search of food and lodging. The soles of our feet were calloused and cut from walking on the river bed. We were hungry and found mirth in just about anything. We found a gas station where James and Aleks were able to buy food. I, what with my Kosher dietary restrictions had to be satisfied with an Oreo and a few potato chips. This was when I tripped. See, I LOVE food. It’s not just an affiliation. It’s a passion. A fellow lost soul from the gas station gave us directions to a nearby Motel. We started walking there, laughing at our stupidity and taking pictures to prove it in the future. Then we decided to save some of our rapidly diminishing funds and simply sleep in the car. Great. We turned around once again and hiked back up the road to where the car was left. Before we got there, we stopped by yet another gas station. Whilst the guys sat outside munching on some more snacks I went into the store to see if I could score some contraband – kidding. I went to use the bathroom. I went in and was so horrified that I lost all urges, even the one to live I think. There was a neatly written note on the wall of the bathroom (see the corresponding photo album to this note) that questioned “Why me, lord?” Whomever wrote that note, however long ago, I was now attached to. Through some invisible yet resilient thread, I felt their pain, I felt their anguish and could not have verbalized it better.</p>
      <p>I walked back to the guys and sat silently, not wanting to be a downer. We resumed our trek. All the way back to the car the night was split with laughter as we fancied ourselves a twisted version of Harold and Kumar cept james was Italian not Asian, I was Trinidadian, not Indian and Aleks was from Uzbakistan so how to fit him in was yet another issue. But guess what, at that time of night, that level of hunger and dehydration, everything worked.Back in the car, Aleks was fast asleep, snoring peacefully. I tossed and turned, not being able to fall asleep due to extreme discomfort, along with the fact that we were in the middle of nowhere surrounded by cornfields the windows were open and we were parked in the lot of some unknown mechanic’s yard. The night got chilly. A garbage truck came by. I was never in such intimate proximity to sleeping adult males. If that’s what we all sound like when we sleep, I’d like to apologize on behalf of my gender to women everywhere. What with all the grunts, snorts, snores and other sound effects emanating from various orifices, I think these guys could’ve given the last band a run for their money. Oh how I detested Aleks and the fact the height was one of his vertical challenges! Looking into the back seat to see him snoring away and curled up, whilst my legs were under the engine, I sighed and tried yet again (in vain) to find some position that was conducive to sleep.</p>
      <p>I think I drifted off finally at 6:00AM. We all awoke at 7:00AM. After finally getting the parts we needed installed. We were homeward bound at 10:11 AM. I missed work. I am unable to walk properly for the blisters on my feet. My neck and back are aching from one hour of sleep in a weird position. </p>
      <p>I would do it all again.</p>
