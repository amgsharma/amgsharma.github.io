      <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I had just finished high-school at one of the finest institutions in the Caribbean, joined my mother and brother in NY with no real plans of tertiary education. Simply the desire to leave the island fueled my motive. Shortly after immigrating to New York, I occupied myself with a number of jobs. The first of which was a bookkeeper’s position down on the waterfront in Brooklyn New York. The position was bestowed upon me by the miserly owner of the company through a favor owed to someone or the other. Bookkeeping! Here comes the bare-chested, 3rd-world boy, wild visions of conquering the world prancing in his head! “Do you know Peachtree young man?” Peachtree? I've seen banana trees, passion fruit vines and soursop trees... certainly a peach tree wouldn't be anything foreign to my imagination! Besides, of what relevance was my agricultural knowledge to this job?? The question was more of a preliminary statement before he piled my tasks upon me. His name was Jeff. He was a short, wiry man with flared nostrils and perpetually knitted brows. I wasn't sure why he wanted to know what I knew of trees, and thus I stood silently, waiting at the side of the dusty desk, wondering if he made any money from the establishment at all. While he took his time itemizing my daily tasks as his new employee, I stared out the cracked window past the smoke stacks, over the heads of the Mexican laborers who were less fortunate than I was and had to work outside in the subzero temperatures. The Statue of Liberty stood in the distance, grey, gloomy and portending doom. This was the weather every day that I worked in that ‘office’. Come to think of it, the office wasn’t really an office, it was a small room in the warehouse that the owner probably rented along with the other shifty business men in that area. No, I didn’t know Peachtree, but that wouldn’t last long, I would know it by the next morning. I mastered the software and his accounting system within the first few hours and was bored for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>This was to be my prison for the next few months of my life. I took the NYC subway to the part of Brooklyn that was deserted by all else. I remember one morning on the train, this Caucasian male, dressed in workers boots, ripped jeans and a hard hat, who fancied himself a regular playboy, seated himself next to a perm-pressed woman in my carriage. By now I was accustomed to these scenarios and waited for her to wrinkle her nose in disgust and turn to the window while praying for her stop to come sooner. Instead, what I saw befuddles me till this day! He actually put his mould covered armpit around her and asked her what she was doing later on that evening, WHILE winking at this buddy across the carriage! Then, (and if some woman who reads this can explain the following phenomena to me, please do), she BLUSHED and gave that annoying sort of coy-but interested-but-playing-hard-to-get look!! Really?? Ah the happenings of the New York city subway…</p>
      <p>This was my first glimpse at ‘The Real World”. Huddling next to a small electric heater in the corner of a dusty, cramped office with nothing to keep me entertained I absorbed the nuances of an echelon in NYC social hierarchy that I hope never to see again. So this was a ‘job’… Some mind-numbing repetitive task that people subjected themselves to, everyday of their miserable existence, comforting themselves with the fantasy that someday, somehow, they would scrounge together enough pennies to take a short vacation, or perhaps buy a house or a luxurious car. Hope, is the pacifier of the masses.</p>
      <p>It was also then that I tasted real Mexican food (as opposed to the restaurants that claim to serve it) for the first time. Once, I felt adventurous enough to join the Mexicans at the hour that they took their lunch break. I waited till they started filing out of the gate and sauntered casually next to them. They all seemed to be headed towards a mobile food unit parked on the corner about a block away. I tried to blend in as best as I could, but being at least 2 feet taller than the average person, I fear I stood out like a tall Trinidadian amongst a bunch of Mexicans going for lunch. I stood in line, straining my ear to listen to what each person ordered, so that I would know what to say when it was my turn. Unfortunately, my 5 years of high-school Spanish was not sufficient for their rapid local lingo. When I found myself at the front of the line, I was bewildered and slightly embarrassed. I wasn’t at that stage Americanized enough to feign a “Yo quiero Taco!”. Fortunately the gruff hombre’s wife saw the look on my face and leaned over and asked me in broken English if I wanted to try some sort of black bean combination. I eagerly nodded yes (a bit to enthusiastically I’m afraid), for I was just relieved to have that moment dead and buried. I received a sort of a wrap that smelt like boiled veal and looked less appetizing. Nonetheless, I followed my new amigos and perched myself on the sidewalk, took off my gloves and unwrapped the mysterious wrap. I took note of the gusto with which the men and women around me devoured their wraps and followed suit, taking a huge bite. I immediately got up and walked quickly around the corner from where they all lounged. I did not want to offend anyone as I spat the stuff out. I threw the remainders into a nearby trash and walked to a cornerstore where I purchased some Oreo cookies and strawberry milk and then walked back to my dark, dusty office. I don’t even remember the last day that I worked at that place. Though, I do remember my boss’s internet password and the exact net worth of his company to 2 decimal places.</p>
